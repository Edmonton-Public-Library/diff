Project Notes
-------------
This script outputs the difference between text files based on comparison of lines in each.
Funtionally it allows the specification truth operations 'and', 'or', and 'not' to text files comparisons.

Syntax:
STATEMENT: ( EXPRESSION ) OPERATOR ( EXPRESSION )
EXPRESSION: FILE OPERATOR FILE
OPERATOR: and, or, not
FILE: text file name

Instructions for Running:
Example: echo "file1.txt or file2.txt" | diff.pl would output the contents of both files.
Example: echo "file1.txt and file2.txt" | diff.pl would output lines that match in both files.
         echo "file1.txt not file2.txt" | diff.pl outputs lines from file1.txt that are not in file2.txt
		 
diff.pl reads both files and orders the contents in alpha-numeric order, then compares the two lists.
White space is always ignored at the start and end of the lines being compared.
